<!-- My favorite band, I got to see Ghost live last year, it was awesome and then got to see the concert movie which was also peak-->
    <h1 id="top">My Website for Web Class Assigments</h1>

<!-- It wasn't this front man you see here, that's Papa Emeritus II, we are currently on IV/Copia but he's now Frater Imperator. They haven't shown us what Papa V will look like -->
    <p>If the image of <strong>Secondo</strong> didn't already make you turn away from this, greetings!
        I'm Elwood Wardle, and if you're asking no that's not my legal first name, I use the name since I'm nonbinar. Yes, I picked it cause of Elwood Blues :]<br>
        The last name however is mine and yes, it's british sadly. I am a college student right now that's getting my <em>graphic design degree</em>, yes the same job
        that is slowly being taken over by ai because corporations are greedy, I picked a great time for this.<br> For now currently this page is a place for me to store
        all of my current assigments for me and my professor to see so if you aren't her, I'm very confused as to how you got here. I guess you can just, stare at the image.
        My plans for this website after this class is simple: I'm going to turn it into a place where I can show off my many collectibles. Yes that's right, I collect, sometimes too much. It is decked out in figures, dvds, trinkets,
        plushies, books, and <strong>much more</strong>. Heck I've even got stuff that is way older than me! It's a hobby I started when I was little and I'm still being gifted items for my collections to this day.

<!-- So the oldest piece I have is Chitty Chitty Bang Bang book that's a tie in with the movie from 1963. But also I have a newspaper ad with Thurl Ravenscroft that might be older -->
