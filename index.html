    <p>Hi, I'm Elwood. If anyone's asking that isn't the name on my birth certificate, it's what I perfer to go by <br>
        I'm <strong>nonbinary [He/They]</strong> and 20, currently at college as a graphic design student. And yes I know, I picked a great time to decide to do art as my career. <br>
        This website will be used to document and share my web design assignments and projects. Plus an image tossed in here and there for fun :]
