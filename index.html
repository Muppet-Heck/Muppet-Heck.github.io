    <p>If the image of <strong>Secondo</strong> didn't already make you turn away from this, greetings!
        I'm Elwood Wardle, and if you're asking no that's not my legal first name, but it's what I use as my chosen name since I nonbinary :]
        The last name however is mine and yes, it's british sadly. I am a college student right now that's getting my <em>graphic design degree</em>, yes the same job
        that is slowly being taken over by ai because corporations are greedy, I picked a great time for this. For now currently this page is a place for me to store
        all of my current assigments for me and my professor to see so if you aren't her, I'm very confused as to how you got here. I guess you can just, stare at the image.
        My plans for this website after this class is simple: I'm going to turn it into a place where I can show off my many collectibles. Yes that's right, I collect, sometimes too much. It is decked out in figures, dvds, trinkets,
        plushies, books, and <strong>much more</strong>. Heck I've even got stuff that is way older than me! It's a hobby I started when I was little and I'm still being gifted items for my collections to this day.
